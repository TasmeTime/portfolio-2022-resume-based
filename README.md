# My New Resume Based Portfolio Site

This is my latest portfolio website based on my resume.
Live version: https://resume.m-azad.ir/

I'm aiming to achive:

- good grasp of 'typescript' in react environment
- get some experience at 'animation libs' (haven't decided which lib yet, probably framer motion :/ )
- achieve some kinda slider design for portfolio sections

`this repo will get updated as i go forward`
